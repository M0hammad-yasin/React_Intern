# React Counter & Form Handling App

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple React application developed as part of **Phase 2: Getting Started with React**.  
The goal of this app is to demonstrate fundamental React concepts, specifically **state management** and **form handling**, using functional components and React Hooks.

The application includes:
- A counter feature to increment and decrement values
- A basic form to capture and manage user input
- Proper event handling and state updates using `useState`

This project helps build a strong foundation for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React.
